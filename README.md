# Manufacturing-defect-detection
This project centers around improving manufacturing quality control using AI, specifically computer vision and deep learning for manufacturing

This a collaborative data science project using computer vision and machine learning to identify defects in manufacturing processes.

## Team Members
- Ololade Folashade: Project Lead
- Noel Frank
- Temilola Gbadamosi-Adeniyi

## Objective
Build a lightweigh AI-powered tool for defect and pose detection to enhance operational efficiency and reduce waste in small-scale manufacturing. 

## Stack 
- Python, OpenCV, SCikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Streamlit for demo
- Git & GitHub for collaboration

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/`: Python scripts for pipeline logic
- `streamli_app demo/`: App files for UI and interactive demo
- `report/`: Final documentation, write-ups
- `results/`: Evaluation outputs and visualizations
- README.md : Project Overview 

## Status 
06 / 28 / 2025 - 07 / 05 / 2025 Currently searching for dataset and preparing project skeleton.
